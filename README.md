# INTENTION
The INTENTION project is a European subproject [http://eurobench2020.eu] that aims to research the impact on the physical human-exoskeleton interaction of the traditional controllers of trajectory and admittance, widely used in the literature, compared to control based on the detection of the onset of muscle contraction (EMG onset) and evaluate the feasibility of using intramuscular EMG signal versus surface EMG signals.

The hypothesis of this project is that EMG-onset trigger controller would improve human-exoskeleton interaction, providing assistance that relieves user effort during walking. Along with testing this hypothesis, the INTENTION project also aims at conducting the experiments using the testbeds and protocols developed within EUROBENCH, which will constitute a validation of the testbeds.
